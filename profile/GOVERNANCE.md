# Project Governance
## Maintainers 
### What's a Maintainer?
Maintainers are open source contributors who have been granted write access (or above -- `Maintain` or `Admin` level in GitHub) entitlements to the project's repository, specifically write access to protected branches (e.g., the `main` branch). This write level access to protected branches imparts upon the maintainer the ability to accept and merge pull requests from other contributors into these protected branches. In most open source projects, maintainers act as a de facto board of directors who set the direction of the projects, and together do collaborative product management, by din of their ability to commit changes. 

### Maintainer Selection for projects in the `goldmansachs` GitHub organization
New maintainers are elected by a majority vote of the existing maintainers. If there are an even number of maintainers than a tie vote means the new maintainer is not elected. 

### Goldman Sachs Maintainer Requirement
All projects hosted in the [`goldmansachs` GitHub org](https://github.com/goldmansachs) must have at all times at least one maintainer who is a GS employee. In the event the only GS employee-maintainer leaves Goldman Sachs, an employee-maintainer will be appointed by the Managing Director (MD) for Open Source matters for Goldman Sachs or the Open Source Program Office Lead (who themselves may serve in this capacity if an interested employee cannot be readily identified), at until such time that another GS employee can be elected as maintainer by the remainder of the maintainer community. 

### Maintainer Removal
* Resignation by the maintainer her/him/themself from their maintainer duties
* Resignation by a maintainer who is also a Goldman Sachs employee from their employment at Goldman Sachs 
    * If upon resignation of a Goldman Sachs employee-maintainer from the firm, the remaining maintainers may choose to "re-elect" that individual as a maintainer to continue on as a maintainer outside of their Goldman Sachs capacity.
* Majority vote of the other maintainers 
    * If there are an even number of maintainers (other than the candidate for removal) than a tie vote means the maintainer is not removed.
* At the discretion of the Goldman Sachs Managing Director (MD) for Open Source matters or the Goldman Sachs Open Source Program Office Lead at Goldman Sachs, especially and in particular for any cases that may arise where Goldman Sachs deems that a maintainer's continued write access to a repository might present some level of unacceptable risk. 

### Maintainer Meetings
The maintainers of projects hosted in the [`goldmansachs` GitHub org](https://github.com/goldmansachs) are expected to meet once per quarter to review on-going development and progress of their projects, the project roadmap, etc.

Projects that do not hold such a maintainer meeting two quarters in row will be deemed candidates for archiving by the Goldman Sachs Open Source Program Office.
